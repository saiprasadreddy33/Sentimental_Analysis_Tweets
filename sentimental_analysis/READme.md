***Naive Bayes Classifier for Sentiment Analysis***

This is a Python implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis, which is the task of determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The implementation uses the Naive Bayes algorithm from the nltk package, and the training data is read from text files.


This code uses the Naive Bayes classifier to perform sentiment analysis on a set of tweets. The tweets are classified as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the tweet.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    nltk package
Dependencies

This code requires the following dependencies:

    nltk package (Natural Language Toolkit) for natural language processing tasks
    numpy package for numerical computing

To install these packages, you can run the following commands:

pip install nltk
pip install numpy

Running the code

To run the code, simply execute the main.py file:

python sentiment_analysis.py

This will train the classifier on the training data, and then test it on the test data. The accuracy of the classifier will be printed to the console.

Installation

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/sentiment-analysis.git
    Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
    Run the main script: python main.py

Usage

To use this code for sentiment analysis on your own set of tweets, follow these steps:

    Create two text files: positive.txt and negative.txt.
    In each file, add your positive and negative tweets, one tweet per line.
    Run the main script: python main.py

The classifier will classify the tweets in positive.txt and negative.txt, and will output the total accuracy of the classifier on a set of test tweets.
